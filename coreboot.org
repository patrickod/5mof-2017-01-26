* Coreboot and you
  [[./coreboot.svg]]
* What
  Coreboot (formerly LinuxBIOS) is a FOSS replacement for your BIOS/UEFI
* Why
* Security
** Vendors suck at shipping security patches
   layered vendor ecosystem makes this suck even more
   [[./vendors.jpg]]
** Your BIOS likely likely has unpatched exploits
** The trusted computing base is yuuuuuuuuuuuuge
* Flexibility!
** Ever wanted to yak shave your BIOS??!? Now you can!!!
   [[./yak-shaving.jpg]]
** Multiple payload options
** SeaBIOS
   Minimal legacy BIOS
** Bake Linux into your BIOS!
   2017: The year of Linux on the (laptop) BIOS
** GRUB2
   Perma-GRUB
* Freedom
** Greater control over the software you run
** The 4 freedoms for your BIOS 
  * to run the program as you wish, for any purpose 
  * to study how the program works
  * to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor 
  * to distribute copies of your modified versions to others 
* That's cool! What do I need?
** Prepare to void your warranty
** Get some old thinkpad hardware
   Thinkpad X200, X201, X220, X230 all have great support 
** A Pomona clip 
   [[./clip.jpg]]
** Some SPI flashing hardware
  I've used a BusPirate successfully, others have tried raspberry pis, beaglebones
* Caveats
** It's super finicky
   This took me 3 days to get working
** Make the wires shorter
   Anything over 6 inches between chip & SPI flasher will cause issues w/ interference
** Make the wires shorter again
   Seriously, it's super important
** Buy a power supply
   The EEPROM needs power, and your 3.3V supply from the Pi or Beaglebone is unlikely to be enough
** ... or use WoL trickery
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  * Take the battery out
  * Plug in the AC adapter
  * Boot the machine and power it off
  * Plug in a connected (link) ethernet cable
  * Observe that the link light blinks & the board is powered!
  * Don't ever connect the 3.3V source *and* the AC adapter at the same time
* Bonus round: Control the big bad ME!
** The Intel ME 
   An entirely separte co-processor within your CPU that you don't control.
** The bad
   Has Direct Memory Access, its own network interface and much much more
** The ugly
 #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   * Has vulnerabilities!
   * Answers to Intel only
   * Since the SandyBridge generation ME also required for CPU initialization
   * Without a functioning ME your machine will shutdown after 30 minutes
   * You can't just zero it out
** The free

** Sweet liberation
